#(x['red']): In each iteration, x is one of the dictionaries from game_data.

# This is the primary way to iterate through a dictionary in Python. You just need to put the dictionary directly into a for loop, and youâ€™re done!
# If you use this approach along with the [key] operator, then you can access the values of your dictionary while you loop through the keys:
